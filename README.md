# IMPORTANT NOTES

Important code is found in the following files:
- index.js (skeleton code for what we'll do in class)
- .env (file where you'll put your important API info - e.g. keys, client ID and secret)

Modules have been added as dependencies so you just need to do **npm i**.

This example uses the [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) API. You'll need to create an account.
